# irssi-cowsay-fortune
Cowsay and fortune command wrapper for irssi IRC client. Improves the quality of one's life in IRC considerably.

Disclosure: Personal project just for giggles, serves also as an entry point for the author to PERL scripting so the code quality isn't necessarily all-time high with this.

# Dependencies

cowsay and fortune shell commands.

# Installation
The script can be taken into use with the following steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run "make install" in the root folder
3. In irssi, load the script. E.g. "/script load ~/.irssi/scripts/cowsay.pl

# To do

Preferably this package would be debian-packaged and dependencies to fortune and cowsay would be handled explicitly.
